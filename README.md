# VerilogPractice

This project contains codes which was used to gain exposure to verilog and practice digital logic concepts. All links and tools listed below are used solely for the purpose of learning verilog and digital logic concepts.

**NOTE:** projects in this repo are done solely without any hardware (i.e. a FPGA dev board). Projects in this repo will eventually be verified on some hardware platform which will be indicated later on in the section below.

## Software Requirement

Any of the below can be used:

* ModelSim + Mentor Graphics Precision RTL **(Optional)**
* Icarus Verilog + GTKWave - **(Should include synthesis option but not tested!)**
* Vivado/ISE
* Quartus Prime

Projects in this repo are compiled using ModelSim. However, efforts will be made to ensure all projects are compilable across all software tools and projects will be synthesizable.

## Hardware Requirement (Optional)

The board(s) listed below are potential requirement which can likely be used for hardware verification later on. It is simply a sort of wish list or future planning which will be executed at an undetermined time in the future.

* DE-2 Development Board
* DE10-Nano Development Board

## Project Verification

This section will outlines a checklist for what has been verified for the projects in this repo.

| Verification(s)                   | Current Status    |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Compliable                        | Completed         |
| Simulation Correctness            | Completed         |
| Synthesizable                     | Completed         |
| Hardware Platform Verification    | TBD               |

## Online Compilation Resource

EDA playground is an online "compiler" which allow engineers to simulate various HDLs
